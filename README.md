# Introduction to GIS in R
This repository contains materials covering an introduction to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in R, and is meant to complement LSHTM's corresponding 2 day course which is taught in ArcGIS. It relies on the simple features (sf) package. The rendered main materials are [here](https://julianmatthewman.github.io/LSHTM-GIS/), and the repository contains two further training notebooks.
